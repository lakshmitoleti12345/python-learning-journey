This repository documents my daily progress while learning Python from scratch. Focused on building strong programming fundamentals through consistent practice and structured problem solving.
📘 Day 01 – Python Fundamentals (If-Else Practice)

This folder contains my Day 01 practice programs while learning Python fundamentals.

Today’s focus was on understanding conditional statements (if-else) and building basic logical thinking.

🔹 Programs Covered

Odd or Even number checker

Positive or Negative number checker

Largest of three numbers

Swap two numbers

Simple Calculator using if-else

🔹 Concepts Practiced

Taking user input

Type casting (int, float)

Conditional statements

Basic arithmetic operations

Logical comparison

📅 Day 2 – Python Number Logic Practice
📌 Overview

On Day 2 of my Python practice journey, I focused on strengthening logical thinking by solving number-based problems using loops and conditional statements.

The goal was to improve control over iteration, conditional logic, and mathematical reasoning.
1️⃣ Print 1 to N Numbers

Concept Used: for loop / while loop
Description:
This program prints numbers from 1 to N based on user input.

Logic:

Take input value N

Use loop to iterate from 1 to N

Print each number

Example:Input: 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
2️⃣ Sum of N Numbers

Concept Used: Loop + Accumulator variable
Description:
This program calculates the sum of first N natural numbers.

Logic:

Initialize sum = 0

Loop from 1 to N

Add each number to sum

Print final sum

Example:
Input: 5
Output: 15
3️⃣ Multiplication Table

Concept Used: Loop
Description:
This program prints the multiplication table of a given number.

Logic:

Take input number

Loop from 1 to 10

Multiply and print results

Example:
Input: 3
Output:
3 x 1 = 3  
3 x 2 = 6  
...  
3 x 10 = 30
4️⃣ Factorial of a Number

Concept Used: Loop / Mathematical Logic
Description:
This program calculates the factorial of a given number.

Formula:
n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1

Logic:

Initialize fact = 1

Multiply numbers from 1 to N

Print result
Example:
Input: 5
Output: 120
5️⃣ Reverse a Number

Concept Used: While loop + Modulus operator
Description:
This program reverses the digits of a number.

Logic:

Extract last digit using % 10

Add it to reversed number

Remove last digit using // 10

Repeat until number becomes 0

Example:Input: 1234
Output: 4321
Day 3------------
in this day i do patterns
#how many rows and columns
# how many stars in first row
# stars increasing or decreasing
